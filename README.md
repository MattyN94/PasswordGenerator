As part of the FreeCodeCamp 'Scientific Computing with Python Certification' there is a module called 'Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Password Generator'.
The main.py file in this Repository is the result of completing this section of FreeCodeCamp.
To expand on this project, I wrote basic HTML/CSS to create a user interface for potential use as a password generating application.
